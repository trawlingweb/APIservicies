# Trawlingweb.com Telegram API

Welcome to the Trawlingweb.com Telegram API documentation. Our API provides access to structured data from **public Telegram channels and public groups messages**. Our advanced systems analyze, process, and structure this data for on-demand querying, offering an efficient and tailored solution for your public messaging analytics needs.

## Key Features:

* **Credit-Based Subscription**: Service subscription based on credit plans redeemable for keyword searches, where 1 credit = 1 keyword. This allows clients to choose the number of credits they wish to purchase, enabling them to create and monitor keywords within Telegram.
* **Keywords**: A Keyword is a search term configured within a "worker". The number of Keywords you can register depends on the credits purchased (1 credit = 1 Keyword). Workers use these keywords to filter the indexed Telegram messages and gather derived data, which is stored and available for query and download via REST API. Therefore, workers function as a list of keywords.

    Examples of keywords and credits required for creation:

|   Keyword   | Number of Elements | Credits Required (c1) |                          Executable Search                          |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  @cocacola  |         1          |           1           | Mentions of an account or what an account posts containing other keywords |
|  cocacola   |         1          |           1           | Exact term in the message text                                       |
| "coca cola" |         1          |           1           | Exact phrase in the message text                                     |
