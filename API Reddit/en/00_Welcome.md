# Trawlingweb.com Reddit API

Welcome to the Trawlingweb.com Reddit API documentation. Our API provides access to structured data from **public Reddit posts and comments**. Our advanced systems analyze, process, and structure this data for on-demand querying, offering an efficient and tailored solution for your forum analytics needs.

## Key Features:

* **Credit-Based Subscription**: Service subscription based on credit plans redeemable for keyword searches, where 1 credit = 1 keyword. This allows clients to choose the number of credits they wish to purchase, enabling them to create and monitor keywords within Reddit.
* **Keywords**: A Keyword is a search term configured within a "worker". The number of Keywords you can register depends on the credits purchased (1 credit = 1 Keyword). Workers use these keywords to filter the indexed Reddit posts and comments and gather derived data, which is stored and available for query and download via REST API. Therefore, workers function as a list of keywords.

    Examples of keywords and credits required for creation:

|     Keyword     | Number of Elements | Credits Required (c1) |                          Executable Search                          |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   u/cocacola    |         1          |           1           | Mentions of a user or what a user posts containing other keywords    |
|    cocacola     |         1          |           1           | Exact term in post/comment text                                       |
|   "coca cola"   |         1          |           1           | Exact phrase in post/comment text                                     |
