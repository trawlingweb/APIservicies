# Reddit API - POST Method /create

Allows creating new Workers with their keywords.

## What is a Worker?

A Worker in TrawlingWeb is a user-configured entity to perform specific searches over the indexed posts and comments from Reddit using Keywords. These Keywords are search terms configured within the Worker and are based on the contracted credits (1 credit = 1 Keyword).

## Creation and Configuration of Workers

Users can create and define search terms for each Worker directly on the dashboard ([https://dashboard.trawlingweb.com/workers](https://dashboard.trawlingweb.com/workers)) or using the method provided by the API. Once a Worker is created, it starts filtering the stream of indexed posts and comments according to its keywords (results become available almost immediately).

## Workers Functionality

* **Keywords**: Workers function as a list of keywords. They use the configured Keywords to filter the stream of public posts and comments indexed from Reddit.
- **Search Process**: Workers apply keywords against the `text`, `user_name`, `user_screen_name`, and `subreddit` fields of each element.
- **Delivery Process**: Each time the client calls the Worker, it uses the list of Keywords to launch the search against the database of posts and comments indexed by TrawlingWeb and retrieve only those results matching the list of Keywords (combinable with boolean filters via `q=`).

Implementing and managing Workers efficiently allows users to maximize the relevance and accuracy of the processed data, tailored to the specific needs of their Reddit analysis and monitoring.

# POST Parameters

Let's examine the structure of the example query:

```
https://reddit.trawlingweb.com/create/?token={APIKEY}
```

## PATH Parameters:

| Element  | Description                                  |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| protocol | Can be either **http** or **https**          |
| domain   | API address reddit.trawlingweb.com           |
| method   | create                                       |

## QUERY Parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                              | Default           | Example         |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------- |
| token     | Client's APIKEY access to TrawlingWeb system.            | Required value    | ?token={APIKEY} |

## BODY Parameters:

| Parameter   | Description                            | Default           | Limits                                                    |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| description | Description of the Worker.              | Required value    | String up to 200 characters                                |
| words       | Search keywords.                       | Required value    | Number of words not exceeding agreed limit                  |

### Structure of the words parameter

The `words` parameter must be sent as a **JSON array** of text strings, where each array element represents a Keyword. Each Keyword can be a simple term, a quoted phrase, or a mention (u/username).

### Example body in JSON format:

```json
{
    "description": "Example Worker for brand monitoring",
    "words": [
        "cocacola",
        "\"coca cola\"",
        "u/cocacola"
    ]
}
```

In this example, the Worker is created with 3 Keywords:
1. A simple term: "cocacola"
2. An exact phrase: "coca cola"
3. A mention: "u/cocacola"

Each element in the `words` array consumes 1 credit (1 credit = 1 Keyword).

```

# Enhanced Searches with Reddit Syntax

Reddit is mostly plain text within topical subreddits. The effective syntax for defining keywords centers on exact terms, quoted phrases, mentions (u/username), and subreddit filters. This syntax allows filtering results by terms, phrases, author, subreddit, and date ranges. When defining keywords for a Worker, this syntax maximizes the efficiency and relevance of the data processed.

Here's a list of elements you can combine with your keywords when creating them within a worker:

| Type              | Description                                                                          | Example keyword                | Result                                                                           |
| ----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exact term        | Single word without special characters                                                | cocacola                       | returns posts/comments containing the word **cocacola**                              |
| Exact phrase      | Multi-word phrase enclosed in double quotes                                           | "coca cola"                    | returns posts/comments containing the exact phrase **coca cola**                     |
| Mention (u/)      | Users referenced with u/                                                              | u/cocacola                     | returns posts/comments where u/cocacola is tagged or matches the author              |

> To filter by subreddit, use `subreddit:name` inside the `q=` parameter in the `/posts/` call. See the boolean syntax section.

## Reserved Characters in Search Keywords

> The reserved characters are: + - = & | > < ! ¡ () {} [] ^ " ~ * ¿ ?: \ / ' -
