# Worker characteristics

Indexed data is stored in monthly indices `reddit_YYYY_MM` with the retention agreed in the client's plan (typically the last months queryable via `ts`/`tsi`).

Users can delete a specific Worker. This deletion destroys the Worker's configuration. Historical data associated with the Worker can no longer be queried through it once removed.

When a Worker is deleted, the consumer's available Workers counter is incremented again (as long as it does not exceed the plan's `counter_limit`).
