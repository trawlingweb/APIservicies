# Trawlingweb.com Twitter API

Welcome to the Trawlingweb.com Twitter API documentation. Our API provides access to structured data from public Twitter posts. Our advanced crawlers download, structure, and store this content for on-demand queries, offering an effective and personalized solution for your social media analysis needs.

## Key Features:

* **Credit Plan Subscription**: Service subscription based on purchasing credit plans, which are redeemable for a number of keywords, where 1 credit = 1 keyword. This way, the client can choose the number of credits they want to purchase, allowing them to create and monitor keywords within the social network.
* **Keywords**: A Keyword is a search term configured within a "worker". The number of Keywords you can register depends on the credits purchased (1 credit = 1 Keyword). The "workers" use these keywords to perform searches on social networks and collect specific data, which is stored and available for query and download via the REST API. Therefore, workers function as a list of keywords.

    Examples of keywords and credits needed for their creation:

|           Keyword           | Number of Elements | Credits Needed (c1) |                          Executable Search                          |
