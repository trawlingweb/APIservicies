# Twitter API - Service Access

## User Registration

To access the service, you need to be registered as a user on [www.trawlingweb.com](www.trawlingweb.com). If you are not yet a TrawlingWeb user, you can register for free [here](https://dashboard.trawlingweb.com/register).

Once registered, you will receive the trial user role. This role allows you to access the client area and perform a limited number of Worker configurations for free.

## Service Subscription

Once the trial period is over, users who wish to continue using the service or expand it will need to formalize a contract. TrawlingWeb offers several subscription options based on [keyword credits](00_Presentation.md#Key-Features). This way, the client can choose the number of credits they want to purchase, allowing them to create and monitor keywords within the social network.

## Using the Service via API Access

The TrawlingWeb system has a REST API interface, which allows remote access from a client system. The user's program accesses the TrawlingWeb system and performs automated queries to the Workers.

These automated queries are performed with a custom query language that has its own syntax. We recommend reading this documentation carefully to avoid constructing erroneous queries.

### Using the Service via the PlayGround

You can also access our PlayGround to create keywords within the Workers and check their results more visually, before configuring connections and synchronizations with the API.
