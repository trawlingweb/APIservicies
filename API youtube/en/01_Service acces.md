### API access

TrawlinWeb system's is accessible by API. This interface allow clients to connect to Trawlingweb system through an internet connection. User's software gets data from TrawlingWeb launching scheduled queries. Two types of data are included in the response: news data (required by the query) and metadata or Trawlingweb service data.
