# TikTok API - POST Method /create

Allows creating new Workers with their keywords.

## What is a Worker?

A Worker in TrawlingWeb is a user-configured entity to perform specific searches on social networks using Keywords. These Keywords are search terms configured within the Worker and are based on the contracted credits (1 credit = 1 Keyword).

## Creation and Configuration of Workers

Users can create and define search terms for each Worker directly on the dashboard ([https://dashboard.trawlingweb.com/workers](https://dashboard.trawlingweb.com/workers)) or using the method provided by the API. Once a Worker is created, it begins deployment to initiate its configuration process, which may take up to an hour.

## Workers Functionality

* **Keywords**: Workers function as a list of keywords. They use the configured Keywords to perform searches on social networks.
- **Search Process**: Workers deliver the Keywords to TrawlingWeb's spiders to execute searches on the social network.
- **Delivery Process**: Each time the client calls the Worker, it uses the list of Keywords to launch the search against the database of results obtained by TrawlingWeb and retrieve only those results related to the list of Keywords.

Implementing and managing Workers efficiently allows users to maximize the relevance and accuracy of the captured data, tailored to the specific needs of their social media analysis and monitoring.

# Enhanced Searches with TikTok Syntax

TikTok utilizes its own advanced syntax to execute specific and detailed searches within its platform. This syntax allows filtering results by keywords, hashtags, mentions, locations, dates, and other parameters. When defining keywords for a Worker, you can use this syntax to launch precise queries against TikTok's search engine. This maximizes the efficiency and relevance of the data captured by each Worker, facilitating more effective monitoring and analysis of conversations on TikTok.

Here's a list of elements you can combine with your keywords when creating them within a worker:

| Type              | Description                                                                          | Example                   |
| ----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| Hashtag           | Terms referenced with the # symbol                                                     | #pepsi                     |
| Mention           | Users referenced with the @ symbol                                                      | @cocacola                     |
| Specific Hashtag  | Search for specific hashtags                                                           | #openai                    |
