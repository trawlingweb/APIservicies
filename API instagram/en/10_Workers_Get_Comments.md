# API Instagram - GET Method /comments

Allows you to retrieve **comments** indexed for a specific Instagram post. It is designed as a **drill-down** from `GET /posts`: first you query the publications of a Worker, and then, for each publication whose comments you want to inspect, you make an additional call to `/comments` providing the `post_id`. **Each call to `/comments` is a separate billable query** in your plan.

# GET Parameters

Sample query structure:

```
https://instagram.trawlingweb.com/comments?token={APIKEY}&post_id={POST_ID}
```

## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                                                  | Default                                          | Example                       |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| token     | APIKEY of the client to access the TrawlingWeb system.                       | Required value                                   | ?token={APIKEY}               |
| post_id   | Identifier of the Instagram post whose comments are requested. Obtained from the `post_id` field of the `GET /posts/{WORKERID}` response. | Required value             | &post_id=3893360753113419201 |
| country_pref | Client country preference (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, e.g. `es`). **Required for FeedScale Pay-per-Use contracts**. Omitting it penalises the request cost by x2.5 and risks access blocking. | Required (Pay-per-Use) | &country_pref=es |
| ts        | Initial temporal delimiter. Unix Time format in milliseconds.                | Delimits **30 days** in the past from the request | &ts=1518472804000           |
| tsi       | Final temporal delimiter. Unix Time format in milliseconds.                  | Delimits with the request date                   | &tsi=1524818189854            |
| size      | (Optional) Results per page. Maximum 100 (standard) or 500 (admin).          | 100                                              | &size=50                      |

> **Note — time window**: the `/comments` endpoint uses a default window of **30 days** (vs 1 month for `/posts`), as comments are typically queried over shorter horizons than posts.

> **Note — recommended flow**: first `GET /posts/{WORKERID}` to obtain the list of Worker publications. Then, for each `post_id` whose comments you want to analyse, one call to `GET /comments?post_id=...`. Each call is billed as an independent query.

# ⚠️ Important — sterile calls are also billed

`GET /comments?post_id=X` queries the shared repository of comments indexed by TrawlingWeb. If **nobody** has configured a `subtype=comments` Worker monitoring the author of the requested post, the endpoint will return:

```json
{ "response": { "data": [], "totalResults": 0, "restResults": 0 } }
```

… and **the call will be billed** within your query quota.

**To avoid sterile calls**, make sure you have at least one Worker with `type=instagram` and `subtype=comments` monitoring the authors of the posts whose comments you want to analyse. Worker creation is documented in [04_Workers_Creation.md](./04_Workers_Creation.md).

# Output Response - RESPONSE

Upon making a request, the endpoint returns a structured response. The **wrapper** (`data`, `totalResults`, `restResults`, `next`) is **identical** to `/posts`, but the inner shape of each element is different: each `data[i]` is a comment, not a post.

## Inherited Data from Parent Post

> **Important**: these fields describe the **POST author** and the **post itself**, not the comment author or the comment. They are inherited from the parent post by project convention. If you need to analyse the comment author, **do not use `user_followers` or `user_followed`** — you'll always see those of the media outlet that owns the post.

| Field          | Description                                                | Searchable | Orderable |  Type   | Format        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :-------: | :-----: | :-----------: |
| user_followers | Number of followers of the **parent POST author**.         |     No     |    No     | Integer |               |
| user_followed  | Number of accounts followed by the **parent POST author**. |     No     |    No     | Integer |               |
| published      | Publication date of the **parent POST** (not the comment). |     No     |    No     |  Date   | ISO 8601-UTC  |

## Worker Data (Geographic Classification)

| Field   | Description                                                          | Searchable | Orderable |  Type   | Format               |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :-------: | :-----: | :------------------: |
| country | Country associated with the Worker that indexed the comment (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2). | No | No | String | E.g. `BR`, `ES`, `MX` |
| lang    | Comment language. Automatically derived from the `country` field.    |     No     |    No     | String  | ISO 639-1 (`pt`, `es`, `en`...) |

## Request Data

| Field        | Description                                                             |  Type   |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----: |
| requestLeft  | Total remaining queries for the subscription.                           | Integer |
| totalResults | Total results found for the query.                                      | Integer |
| restResults  | Remaining results after the current `size`.                             | Integer |
| next         | URL to continue pagination and retrieve all results.                    | String  |

# Key Differences vs `/posts`

Although both endpoints share authentication and wrapper, they serve different entities. These fields have **the same name with different meaning**:

| Field        | In `/posts`                          | In `/comments`                          |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `user_name`  | Post author (media outlet account)   | **Comment** author (a different person) |
| `text`       | Post caption                         | **Comment** text                        |
| `likes`      | Post likes                           | **Comment** likes                       |
| `type`       | "photo" / "video" / "carousel"       | Always `"comment"`                      |

# Best Practices

## Recommended usage flow

1. **`GET /posts/{WORKERID}`** — obtain the list of Worker publications.
2. For each `post_id` from the response that you want to analyse:
3. **`GET /comments?post_id={POST_ID}`** — obtain that post's comments.

Each call to `/comments` is billed individually. Only request the `post_id`s you actually intend to process.

## Data Integrity

Each API request can return a maximum of **100 items** (standard). If the total comments exceed that cap, you must continue making calls to the URL indicated in the **next** parameter of each response.

## Pagination

When making requests to `/comments?post_id=...`, the API returns at most 100 results (or 500 for admin tokens). When more exist, a `next` URL is included to continue.

## Coverage

For a comment to appear in this endpoint, somebody must have configured a `subtype=comments` Worker monitoring the post author. If you request a `post_id` that **nobody** monitors, you'll receive `data: []` and `totalResults: 0` — and the call will be billed. Before drilling down at scale, ensure you have comments Workers configured for the accounts you care about.
