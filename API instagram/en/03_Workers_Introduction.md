## What is a Worker?

A **Worker** in TrawlingWeb is a key entity that allows users to perform automated and specific searches on social networks, particularly Instagram, using Keywords. These Workers are configured by users to track, capture, and analyze content in real-time or at specified intervals, according to their specific needs.

### How Workers Work

- **Keywords:** Each Worker is associated with one or more Keywords, which are search terms defined by the user. These terms can include hashtags, mentions, or any relevant word or phrase for monitoring content on Instagram. The effectiveness of a Worker depends on the accuracy and relevance of the configured Keywords.

- **Credits:** The number of Keywords a user can configure within a Worker depends on the number of credits available in their TrawlingWeb account. In TrawlingWeb, 1 credit equals 1 Keyword. Therefore, if a user has 10 credits, they can configure up to 10 Keywords for one or multiple Workers.

- **Searches and Results:** Once configured, the Worker begins to track Instagram for content that matches the specified Keywords. The content found (posts, comments, mentions, etc.) is processed and stored in a database, allowing the user to access, analyze, and generate detailed reports on this data.

- **Search Intervals:** Users can configure their Workers to perform searches at specific intervals, adjusting the frequency of queries according to the level of detail and the timeliness of the information they need. This is particularly useful for real-time monitoring campaigns where the immediacy of information is crucial.

- **Customization:** Workers in TrawlingWeb offer a high degree of customization, allowing users to fine-tune their searches with additional criteria such as dates, geographic location, content language, type of post (photo, video), and more. This customization ensures that the results obtained are highly relevant and specific to the user's needs.

### Example of Use

Suppose a brand wants to monitor in real-time how a new product collection is perceived on Instagram. They configure a Worker in TrawlingWeb with Keywords such as the collection name, related hashtags, and mentions of the brand's official account. As Instagram users post content about the collection, the Worker captures and stores these posts, allowing the brand to analyze the overall sentiment, identify influencers, and respond quickly to interactions.

### Benefits of Using Workers in TrawlingWeb

- **Efficiency:** Workers automate the process of searching and monitoring Instagram, saving the user time and effort.
- **Scalability:** Users can adjust the number of Workers and Keywords according to their needs and available credits.
- **Precision:** By customizing Keywords and other search criteria, the results are highly relevant, enabling more effective analysis.
- **Immediacy:** Ideal for campaigns requiring real-time information, such as crisis management or product launches.

In summary, a Worker in TrawlingWeb is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing large volumes of data on Instagram, providing valuable insights that can guide strategic decisions in real-time.
