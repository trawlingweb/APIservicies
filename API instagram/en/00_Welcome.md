# Trawlingweb.com Instagram API

Welcome to the Trawlingweb.com Instagram API documentation. Our API provides access to structured data from public Instagram posts. Our advanced crawlers download, structure, and store this content for on-demand querying, offering an efficient and tailored solution for your social media analytics needs.

## Key Features:

* **Credit-Based Subscription**: Service subscription based on credit plans redeemable for keyword searches, where 1 credit = 1 keyword. This allows clients to choose the number of credits they wish to purchase, enabling them to create and monitor keywords within the social network.
* **Keywords**: A Keyword is a search term configured within a "worker". The number of Keywords you can register depends on the credits purchased (1 credit = 1 Keyword). Workers use these keywords to perform searches on social networks and gather specific data, which is stored and available for query and download via REST API. Therefore, workers function as a list of keywords.

    Examples of keywords and credits required for creation:

|     Keyword     | Number of Elements | Credits Required (c1) |                          Executable Search                          |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
