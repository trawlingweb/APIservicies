# Instagram API - Service Access

## User Registration

To access the service, you must be registered as a user at [www.trawlingweb.com](https://www.trawlingweb.com). If you are not yet a TrawlingWeb user, you can register for free [here](https://dashboard.trawlingweb.com/register).

Once registered, you will receive a trial user role. This role grants access to the client area and allows for a limited number of Worker configurations for free.

## Service Subscription

After the trial period, users wishing to continue using or expanding the service must enter into a formal contract. TrawlingWeb offers various subscription options based on [keyword credit](00_Presentation.md#Key-Features) packages. This allows clients to choose the number of credits they wish to purchase, enabling them to create and monitor keywords within the social network.

## Service Usage via API Access

The TrawlingWeb system provides a REST API interface for remote access from a client system. The user's program accesses the TrawlingWeb system and performs automated queries to the Workers.

These automated queries are performed using a specific query language with its own syntax. We recommend carefully reading this documentation to avoid constructing incorrect queries.

### Service Usage via PlayGround Access

You can also access our PlayGround to create keywords within the Workers and visually check their results before setting up connections and synchronizations with the API.
