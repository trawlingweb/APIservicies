# Trawlingweb.com's Facebook API

Welcome to the documentation of Trawlingweb.com's Facebook API. Our API provides access to structured data from public Facebook posts. Our advanced crawlers download, structure, and store these contents for on-demand querying, offering an effective and tailored solution for your social media analysis needs.

## Key Features:

* **Credit-Based Subscription**: Service subscription is based on purchasing credit plans redeemable for keyword usage, where 1 credit = 1 keyword. This allows clients to choose the number of credits they wish to subscribe to, enabling them to create and monitor keywords within the social network.

* **Keywords**: A Keyword is a search term configured within a "worker". The number of Keywords you can register depends on the credits purchased (1 credit = 1 Keyword). Workers use these keywords to conduct searches on social networks and collect specific data, which is stored and available for querying and download via REST API. Therefore, workers function as a list of keywords.

    Examples of keywords and credits required for their creation:

|           Keyword           | Number of Elements | Required Credits (c1) |                     Executable Search                     |
