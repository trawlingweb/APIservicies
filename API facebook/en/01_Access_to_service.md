# Facebook API - Service Access

## User Registration

To access the service, it is necessary to be registered as a user on [www.trawlingweb.com](https://www.trawlingweb.com). If you are not yet a TrawlingWeb user, you can register for free [here](https://dashboard.trawlingweb.com/register).

Once registered, you will receive the role of a trial user. This role allows access to the client area and limited configuration of Workers for free.

## Service Subscription

After the trial period, users who wish to continue using or expand the service must enter into a formal contract. TrawlingWeb offers various subscription options based on [keyword credits](00_Presentation.md#Main-Features). This allows the client to choose the amount of credits they wish to subscribe to, which enables them to create and monitor keywords within the social network.

## Service Usage via API Access

TrawlingWeb's system features a REST API interface, enabling remote access from a client system. The user's program accesses TrawlingWeb's system and performs automated queries to the Workers.

These automated queries are conducted using a proprietary query language with its own syntax. We recommend carefully reading this documentation to avoid constructing erroneous queries.

### Service Usage via PlayGround Access

You can also access our PlayGround to create keywords within the Workers and visually check their results before configuring connections and synchronizations with the API.
