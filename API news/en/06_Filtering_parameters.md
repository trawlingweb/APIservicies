## How to build a filter expression

    q = "(filtro1: valor1) operador (filtro2 : valor2) operador ... (filtroN : valorN__)"

> The spaces between the parts of the expression have been added only in order to gain clarity.

## More information

More information is avaiable in the complete [Lucene's syntax Manual](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html).

## Scaping special characters

Some characters are part of the query syntax: \+ \- \* && || ! () [] {} ^ " ? ~ : \\ \/

In order to avoid confusions they must be preceded by the "**\\**" character in the query expression. To search (1+1):2 we have to build the querry as it follows: **\\(1\\+1\\)\\:2**.

Let's see another example: to search the URL https://www.linkedin.com we must rewrite as **url:https \:\ / \ / www.linkedin.com**.
