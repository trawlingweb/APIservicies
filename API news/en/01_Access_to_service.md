# API NEWS & BLOGS - Access to the service

## User registration

User must be registered in Trawlingweb database to get access to the service.

Once registration is done, visitor becomes a test user. This role enables clients to get access to the system and launch a set of free queries.

## Subscribing to services

Once the trial period has ended, users who wish to continue using the service or expand it must formalize a contract. TrawlingWeb offers various subscription options based on credits for calls to the News & Blogs API. This way, clients can choose the number of credits they wish to purchase, allowing them to make queries to the database of content captured by TrawlingWeb until the purchased credits are exhausted.

## Access modes

There are two ways to access to the service: through Trawlingweb API for production systems and through web console for testing.

### API access

TrawlinWeb system's is accessible by API. This interface allow clients to connect to Trawlingweb system through an internet connection. User's software gets data from TrawlingWeb launching scheduled queries. Two types of data are included in the response: news data (required by the query) and metadata or Trawlingweb service data.

These automated queries are launched with their own query language. We recommend reading carefully this documentation carefully to avoid the construction of erroneous queries.

### Console access

TrawlingWeb website provides a query console to facilitate a demonstration of the service for trial users. It allows users to construct queries using the same language used for API calls. Therefore, we recommend testing in the console before accessing the API. This helps users become familiar with all available search parameters and learn how to configure filters to retrieve the desired data.
