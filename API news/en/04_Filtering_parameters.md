# API NEWS & BLOGS - Filtering parameters

Filters are attributes assigned by TrawlingWeb to each element during its source and result auditing process. These filters allow you to specify detailed criteria to obtain only the data you need. By applying these filters in your queries, you can refine the results to better match your specific requirements. The available filters are described below:

| Filter        | Description                                                                                                                           |

## How to build a filter expression

    q = "(filter1: value1) operator (filter2: value2) operator ... (filterN: valueN__)"

> The spaces between the parts of the expression have been added only in order to gain clarity.

## More Information on Combination and Search Capabilities
For more information on Lucene operators and syntax, you can refer to [Section 07: Best Practices](#section07_best_practices). You can also consult the complete Lucene syntax manual [here](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html), as it is the basis of our search engine.


## Scaping special characters

Some characters are part of the query syntax: \+ \- \* && || ! () [] {} ^ " ? ~ : \\ \/

In order to avoid confusions they must be preceded by the "**\\**" character in the query expression. To search (1+1):2 we have to build the querry as it follows: **\\(1\\+1\\)\\:2**.

Let's see another example: to search the URL https://www.linkedin.com we must rewrite as **url:https \:\ / \ / www.linkedin.com**.

## Examples of Filters and Booleans within **q=**

As explained in Section 03 Queries, the TrawlingWeb APIs accept boolean queries combined with Lucene syntax expressions.

The `q=` parameter allows for filtering and optimizing the query to obtain the best possible results. Within `q=`, you can use filtering parameters (see ), which are attributes assigned by TrawlingWeb to each element, as well as boolean expressions that are characteristics of the captured content.

Remember that in Section 03 Queries, there is a more complete list of boolean expressions that you can combine with filters within `q=`. Below are some examples of filtering parameters.
