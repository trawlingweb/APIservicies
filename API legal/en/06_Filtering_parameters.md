## How to Assign a Filter Expression

    q = "(_filtro1_: __valor1__) operador (_filtro2_ : valor2) operador ... (_filtroN_ : valorN)"

> In this expression, spaces have been added between terms for clarity, but you should avoid them when making queries.

## More Information on Combination and Search Possibilities

For more information, you can refer to the complete Lucene query syntax manual ( [aquí](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html) ) which is the basis of our search engine.

## Escaping Reserved Characters

If you need to use any of the characters that function as operators in your own query (and not as operators), then you must escape them with an initial backslash.
For example, to search for url: url:https://www.linkedin.com, you need to write your query as url:https \:\ / \ / www.linkedin.com.

> The reserved characters are: + - = && || > <! () {} [] ^ "~ \*?: \ /

Failure to escape these special characters correctly could result in a syntax error that prevents the query from executing correctly.
